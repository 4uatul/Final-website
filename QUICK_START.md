## ðŸ“¸ IMAGE PLACEHOLDER SOLUTION

**Don't have project images yet?** No problem!

The portfolio already uses placeholder images. Just open the website and it will show temporary project images until you add your own.

To use online placeholders temporarily, replace image sources with:
```html
<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x500/2563eb/ffffff?text=Your+Project+Name">
```
